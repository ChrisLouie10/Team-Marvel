How to get started:

Once the repository is cloned and opened in a terminal,

1. Install dependencies for both client and server
   a. To install server dependencies from root folder, run `cd server`, then `npm run install`
   b. To install client dependencies from root folder, run `cd client`, then `npm run install`
2. [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/), if needed.
3. Run server to ensure everything is working.
   a. From root folder, `cd server`, then `npm run dev`
